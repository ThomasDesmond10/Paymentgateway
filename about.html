			<h3>GRIP aspires to provide advice, advocacy, and assistance to the best of its ability, taking into consideration GRIPâ€™s available resources, such as, money and/or staff allocation.
here may be people who have a particular person, such as a family member, that they would like to help specifically.  Through our administrative office, we could establish a special dedicated donation fund account for that specific client.  They would draw from that account based on the services needed.  There would be an administrative fee for GRIP to provide this personalized service.
